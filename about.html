		<h2>About Project</h2>
		<p>
			As a developer of Asfand's Cafe project, I am proud to present a well-designed and user-friendly platform for 
			both customers and staff. With the ability to Login/Register for both customers and staff, 
			the platform offers seamless access to all its features.
			<br><br>
			The platform comes with an advanced management system, allowing staff to manage orders and keep track of 
			sales. Customers can order their favorite drinks with ease, with a comprehensive database of drinks 
			available at their fingertips.
			<br><br>
			One of the standout features of this Cafe project is the reports section, 
			which provides valuable insights into sales, staff, and customer behavior. 
			The management team can also create PTO (Paid Time Off) letters for their employees with ease, 
			using the built-in PTO letter creation button.
			<br><br>
			Overall, this project is a beautiful little gem, with all the essential features for a successful Cafe 
			business. As a developer, I am confident that this platform will serve your business needs for many years 
			to come.
